# ts-loader

This example was built with the official Webpack guides.

Run with `npm run build` and see error.


If you want to see a working example, run `npm run esbuild` instead to use esbuild.

You can even run `deno index.ts` or `ts-node-esm index.ts` to see Deno and TS-Node working with the code as expected.

To see an entire workflow which is working right now, try `npm run node`, which will use esbuild to bundle and NodeJS to execute.
